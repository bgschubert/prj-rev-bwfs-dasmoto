      <!--I made the header an h1 tag (as I've read that there are SEO benefits to doing so) but when the 100px font-size indicated in the spec sheet was applied, the text wrapped to a seond line and pushed most of the relevant page info below the fold.  You'll see in the CSS file, I dropped the font down to 50px to improve the page aesthetics and the overall UX.  Not sure if this is frowned upon but as a developer, I'd like to make these types of suggestions to clients.-->
